## ✅ Introduction to TypeScript

### 🧠 What is it?

TypeScript is a **superpower for JavaScript**.  
It’s just JavaScript — but smarter. It helps you:

- Catch errors **before** running the code
- Know what **type of data** you are working with (like number, string, boolean)
- Make your code easier to understand and maintain

Think of it like this:  
> JavaScript is a pencil ✏️  
> TypeScript is the same pencil, but with an **eraser**, **ruler**, and **sharpening tool** ✨

### ✨ Syntax (How it looks)

It looks just like JavaScript, but with **type annotations**:
```ts
let name: string = "Arif";
let age: number = 25;
```

### 🛒 Real Project Example — E-commerce Website

Imagine you're building an online shopping site like **Amazon**.  
Without TypeScript, you might do this:

```js
let price = "499.99";  // mistake! it's a string
console.log(price * 2);  // NaN (error)
```

With TypeScript:

```ts
let price: number = 499.99;
console.log(price * 2);  // 999.98 ✅
```

So TypeScript helps you **catch this mistake** before the code runs.

### 📍 Where this is used in a project:

- Defining data types for **user info**, **product data**, **API responses**
- Creating **components** in React with correct props
- Working with **forms**, **buttons**, and **backend data**

### 📌 Usage Note:

✅ **Always used in TypeScript projects**  
It’s the base of everything — like learning the alphabet before writing sentences.
